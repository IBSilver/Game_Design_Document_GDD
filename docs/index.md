Styles: Minima, Slate, Cayman
## Introduction
The main objective of a Game Designer is the creation and conceptual development of the video game. Things like the mechanics, the gameplay, the game experience, the story among others are the jobs of a Game Designer.

A game designer must have some fundamental skills:
* Define the game experience
* Design the systems & mechanics
* Create the game

Then there are other extra skills that can be useful such as: Puzzles, Balancing, **Documentation**, etc...

On this site we are going to investigate more in the **documentation** part, more specifically in the **Game Design Document (GDD)**.
