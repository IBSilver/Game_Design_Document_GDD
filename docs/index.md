# Game Design Document (GDD)
Styles: Minima, Slate, Cayman
## Introduction
The main objective of a Game Designer is the creation and conceptual development of the video game. Things like the mechanics, the gameplay, the game experience, the story among others are the jobs of a Game Designer.

A game designer must have some fundamental skills:
* Define the game experience
* Design the systems & mechanics
* Create the game

Then there are other extra skills that can be useful such as: Puzzles, Balancing, **Documentation**, etc...

On this site we are going to investigate more in the **documentation** part, more specifically in the **Game Design Document (GDD)**.

## What is a GDD?
A Game Design Document (GDD) is a document that explains how a specific video game has been made. Is typically a detailed guide that can be used to keep track of the core themes, ideas, styles, features and mechanics of your game project.

The main purpose of a game design document is to communicate the details of your project to either yourself, or to other people, such as team members, publishers or people who will be playing your game, as part of a crowdfunding campaign or early access product.

Put simply, it’s the tool that you’ll use to manage and develop the concept of what your game is, how it’s supposed to work and how it will be built.

## How to create a GDD
When you write your GDD, the most important thing is to think about what you need first. Otherwise, it can be extremely difficult to know what it should contain or how detailed it should be.

For example, what do you want:
* A simple overview page that you can use to keep track of your game’s concepts?
* Be able to keep track of your game’s story, lore or items?
* Be able to show a developer exactly how a feature works or what a level should look like?
* A marketing focussed summary that you can give to publishers or investors?

Your GDD might do one of these things or it might do all of them, but what’s important is that you understand what information your GDD is supposed to provide and who it’s going to provide it to. Knowing that will help you to decide what needs to be included.
